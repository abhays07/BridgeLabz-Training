## 📘 Java Collections – Week 1 Day 2

### 🔹 Collections Framework: List, Set, Queue & Map Interfaces

**Branch:** `java-collections`

Worked on **core Java Collections Framework** by solving **problem-oriented and real-world scenario-based questions**, focusing on **List, Set, Queue, and Map interfaces** and their practical use cases.

---

### 📌 List Interface Problems

* Reversed elements of a list without using built-in reverse methods (ArrayList & LinkedList)
* Counted frequency of elements using Map
* Rotated list elements by a given position
* Removed duplicates while preserving insertion order
* Found the Nth element from the end of a LinkedList using two-pointer logic

---

### 📌 Set Interface Problems

* Checked equality of two sets regardless of order
* Computed union, intersection, and symmetric difference
* Converted HashSet into a sorted list
* Verified subset relationships between sets

---

### 📌 Insurance Policy Management System (Set-Based)

* Managed unique insurance policies using:

  * `HashSet` for fast lookup
  * `LinkedHashSet` for insertion order
  * `TreeSet` for sorting by expiry date
* Retrieved:

  * All unique policies
  * Policies expiring within 30 days
  * Policies by coverage type
  * Duplicate policies by policy number
* Compared performance of different Set implementations

---

### 📌 Queue Interface Problems

* Reversed a queue using only queue operations
* Generated first N binary numbers using a queue
* Simulated hospital triage using `PriorityQueue`
* Implemented a stack using two queues
* Built a circular buffer using a fixed-size queue

---

### 📌 Map Interface Problems

* Word frequency counter using `HashMap`
* Inverted a map while handling duplicate values
* Found key with maximum value
* Merged two maps by summing values
* Grouped employee objects by department

---

### 📌 Real-World Map-Based Systems

* **Insurance Policy Management System**

  * `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap` usage
  * Policy retrieval, expiry filtering, cleanup
* **Voting System**

  * HashMap for vote counting
  * TreeMap for sorted results
  * LinkedHashMap for vote order
* **Shopping Cart**

  * HashMap for prices
  * LinkedHashMap for insertion order
  * TreeMap for price-based sorting
* **Banking System**

  * HashMap for accounts
  * TreeMap for balance sorting
  * Queue for withdrawal processing

## 📅 Week 1 – Day 3: Java I/O Streams & File Handling

**Branch:** `java-collections`

### 🧪 Problems Solved

* **File Handling – Read & Write Text Files**
  Read contents from a source file and wrote them into a new file using `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`, with proper exception handling.

* **Buffered Streams – Efficient File Copy**
  Copied a large file using `BufferedInputStream` and `BufferedOutputStream`, measured performance with `System.nanoTime()`, and compared against unbuffered streams.

* **Read User Input & Save to File**
  Collected user details from console input using `BufferedReader` and wrote them to a file using `FileWriter`.

* **Serialization – Save & Retrieve Objects**
  Serialized a list of `Employee` objects to a file and then deserialized them using object streams.

* **ByteArray Streams – Image Conversion**
  Converted an image to a byte array using `ByteArrayInputStream`/`ByteArrayOutputStream` and recreated the image file.

* **Filter Streams – Uppercase to Lowercase Conversion**
  Read a text file and wrote its contents to another file with uppercase converted to lowercase using buffered character streams.

* **Data Streams – Primitive Data I/O**
  Stored and retrieved student primitive data using `DataOutputStream` and `DataInputStream`.

* **Piped Streams – Inter-Thread Communication**
  Implemented two-thread communication using `PipedOutputStream` and `PipedInputStream`.

* **Large File Line-by-Line Reader**
  Efficiently read a large text file line by line, printing only lines containing a specific keyword.

* **Word Frequency Counter**
  Counted word occurrences in a text file using a `HashMap` and displayed the top 5 most frequent words.
