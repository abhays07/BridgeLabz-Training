## 🔹 Week 2 – Day 7: Advanced Story-Driven OOP Scenarios & Polymorphic Design

**Branch:** `java-oops-practice`

Solved **advanced real-world, story-driven Java OOP problems** focusing on **inheritance hierarchies, interfaces, encapsulation, and runtime polymorphism**, modeled as complete backend systems.

### 🧪 Scenario-Based OOP Problems Solved

* **PayXpress – Utility Bill Payment System**
  Implemented a utility billing system with recurring bills, interface-based payment handling, encapsulated payment state, late-fee calculation, inheritance for utility types, and polymorphic reminder behavior.

* **Bird Sanctuary – Wildlife Management System**
  Designed a bird sanctuary system using inheritance and interfaces to model flying, swimming, both, or neither behaviors. Managed birds using collections, enabled searching by abilities, supported add/remove operations, and generated sanctuary reports using polymorphism.

## 📅 Week 3 – Day 1: Scenario-Based OOP Practice (Core OOP Foundations)

**Branch:** `java-oops-practice`

### 🧪 Problems Solved

* **GeoMeasure Solutions – Line Comparison System**
  Implemented a line comparison system where line objects are created using constructors, internal coordinates are encapsulated, lengths are calculated via methods, and multiple line comparisons are supported using a list.

* **Bag-n-Ball Organizer – Toy Storage System**
  Designed a composition-based model where a `Bag` maintains a collection of `Ball` objects. Implemented capacity checks, add/remove operations, and bag-wise reporting while enforcing encapsulation.

## 📘 Java OOP Practice – Week 3 Day 2

### 🔹 Address Book System (Scenario-Based OOP Application)

**Branch:** `java-oops-practice`

Worked on a **real-world Address Book management system** simulating a contact management product for **DigiContact Pvt. Ltd.**, focusing on clean object design and collection handling.

---

### 📌 Scenario Implemented: Address Book System

* Designed a `Contact` class with personal and communication details
* Used constructors for initializing contact data
* Applied encapsulation to protect sensitive fields
* Implemented CRUD operations on contacts:

  * Add new contact with duplicate validation
  * Edit existing contact by name
  * Delete contact by name
* Implemented search functionality:

  * Search contacts by city
  * Search contacts by state
* Displayed all contacts sorted alphabetically
* Stored contacts using `ArrayList<Contact>`
* Used optional composition with a separate `Address` class
