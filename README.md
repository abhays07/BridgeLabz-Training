## 📘 Java IO Streams Practice

### 🔹 Week 1 – Day 1: CSV & JSON Data Handling (IO Streams)

**Branch:** `java-iostreams-practice`

Worked on **file-based data processing** using Java IO Streams, focusing on **CSV and JSON formats** with real-world, data-centric scenarios.

---

### 🧪 CSV Data Handling – Practice Problems

* Read CSV files and printed student records in structured format
* Created and wrote employee data into CSV files
* Counted total records excluding headers
* Filtered student records based on marks criteria
* Searched employee details by name
* Updated CSV records (salary increment for IT department)
* Sorted records by salary and displayed top-paid employees
* Validated CSV data using regex (email, phone number)
* Converted CSV rows into Java objects and stored them in collections
* Merged multiple CSV files based on common keys
* Processed large CSV files efficiently in chunks
* Detected duplicate records using ID comparison
* Generated CSV reports from database records
* Converted CSV ↔ JSON
* Applied encryption and decryption on sensitive CSV fields

### 🧪 JSON Data Handling – Practice Problems

* Created JSON objects and arrays from Java classes
* Converted Java objects and collections into JSON
* Parsed JSON files and extracted selective fields
* Filtered JSON data based on conditions
* Merged multiple JSON files into one
* Validated JSON structure and fields
* Converted JSON ↔ CSV
* Generated JSON reports from database data

### 🏏 IPL Censor Analyzer – Real-World File Processing

* Read IPL match data from **CSV and JSON files**
* Applied censorship rules:

  * Masked team names
  * Redacted player of the match
* Generated sanitized output files in **CSV and JSON formats**

## 📅 Week 1 – Day 2: Scenario-Based I/O, Annotations & Reflection

**Branch:** `java-iostreams-practice`

Worked on **real-world, scenario-driven Java problems** integrating **Annotations, Reflection, CSV handling, and JSON processing**. Focused on building **tool-like backend utilities** that scan metadata, process structured files, and generate machine-readable outputs.

---

### 🧪 Scenario-Based Problems Implemented

#### **HealthCheckPro – API Metadata Validator**

*(Annotations + Reflection)*

* Scanned controller classes using Reflection
* Detected missing or incorrect API-level annotations
* Processed custom annotations like access-level markers
* Auto-generated structured API metadata for validation and documentation

---

#### **MarkMate – Student Marksheet Generator**

*(CSV + JSON)*

* Read student marks from CSV files
* Processed subject-wise scores per student
* Calculated total, average, and grade
* Exported final report cards in JSON format
* Handled invalid or malformed records gracefully

---

#### **EventTracker – Auto Audit System**

*(Annotations + Reflection + JSON)*

* Identified methods marked with audit annotations using Reflection
* Captured runtime metadata such as timestamps and method details
* Generated structured JSON audit logs for user actions
* Designed reusable audit logic for enterprise-style systems
