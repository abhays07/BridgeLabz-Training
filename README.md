# 📘 Java DSA Practice

This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning journey in Java**, organized **week-wise and day-wise**, focusing on **problem-driven and real-world implementations**.

---

## 📅 Week 1: (Core DSA)

### 🔹 Day 1: Linked List – Initial Setup & Fundamentals

* Created a new Git branch **`java-dsa-practice`**
* Completed **initial project and folder structure setup** for DSA practice
* Worked on **Linked List data structure** and its variations
* Implemented:

  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Circular Linked List
* Practiced **node creation, pointer manipulation, and traversal**
* Handled edge cases such as:

  * Empty list
  * Insertion and deletion at head and tail
  * Circular list traversal
* Followed clean, modular, and readable **DSA coding practices**

---

### 🧪 Problems Implemented

* Student Record Management (Singly Linked List)
* Movie Management System (Doubly Linked List)
* Task Scheduler (Circular Linked List)
* Inventory Management System (Singly Linked List)
* Library Management System (Doubly Linked List)
* Round Robin CPU Scheduling (Circular Linked List)
* Social Media Friend Connections
* Undo / Redo Text Editor
* Online Ticket Reservation System

---

### 🛠 Concepts & Tools Used

* **DSA Concepts**

  * Linked List operations

### 🔹 Day 2: Linked List – Problem Solving & Best Practices

* Continued work on **`java-dsa-practice` branch**
* Solved **multiple problem statements** using:

  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Circular Linked List
* Focused on applying **Linked List best practices** in real-world scenarios
* Strengthened understanding of **efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal**
* Emphasized **clean logic, modular methods, and edge-case handling**

---

### 🧪 Problems Solved

* Student Record Management (Singly Linked List)
* Movie Management System (Doubly Linked List)
* Task Scheduler (Circular Linked List)
* Inventory Management System (Singly Linked List)
* Library Management System (Doubly Linked List)
* Round Robin CPU Scheduling (Circular Linked List)

### 🛠 Best Practices Applied (Linked List)

* Maintained proper **head and tail management**
* Performed **null checks** before traversal or deletion
* Ensured correct **pointer updates** during insert/delete operations
* Prevented **infinite loops** in circular linked lists
* Properly cleared node references to avoid memory issues
* Used **modular and reusable methods**
* Prioritized **clarity and correctness** over complex logic
