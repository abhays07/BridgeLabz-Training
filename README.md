## 🧩 Core Object Relationships Covered

### 🔹 Aggregation (Has-A Relationship)

* Objects can exist independently

* Example: **Library → Books**

### 🔹 Association (Uses-A Relationship)

* Objects are linked but do not own each other
* Many-to-many relationships possible
* Example: **Bank ↔ Customer**, **Doctor ↔ Patient**

* Strong ownership
* Child objects cannot exist without parent
* Deleting parent deletes all children
* Example: **Company → Department → Employee**
