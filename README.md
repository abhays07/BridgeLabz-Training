* Validated single-word inputs
* Checked reverse-word condition (case-insensitive)
* Applied transformation pipelines:

  * Reverse + lowercase + vowel masking
  * Word combination + uppercase conversion
  * Vowel vs consonant counting
  * Extracted first two distinct vowels or consonants
* Handled equal-count and invalid-input scenarios cleanly
* Ensured graceful termination without `System.exit(0)`

## 📅 Week 5 – Day 7: Java 8 Collectors & Scenario-Based Stream Analytics

Worked across **Java 8 programming concepts** with a strong focus on **Collectors API** and **real-world analytical scenarios using Streams**, applying grouping, aggregation, and summarization techniques.

---

## 📌 Java 8 – Collectors API Practice

Implemented multiple use cases to understand **data aggregation and transformation** using Java 8 Collectors.

### 🧪 Work Covered

* **Student Result Grouping**
  Grouped students by grade level and collected their names using `Collectors.groupingBy()`.

* **Word Frequency Counter**
  Counted word occurrences from a paragraph using `Collectors.toMap()`.

* **Order Revenue Summary**
  Calculated total revenue per customer using `Collectors.summingDouble()`.

* **Employee Salary Categorization**
  Grouped employees by department and computed average salary using
  `Collectors.groupingBy()` with `Collectors.averagingDouble()`.

* **Library Book Statistics**
  Derived total pages, average pages, and maximum pages per genre using
  `Collectors.summarizingInt()`.

## 📌 Java 8 – Scenario-Based Employee Analytics (Streams + Collectors)

Solved a **large real-world analytics scenario** on employee data using Java Streams and Collectors.

### 🧪 Analytics Implemented

* Count of male and female employees
* Department-wise employee listing and count
* Average age and salary by gender and department
* Highest, lowest, second & third highest/lowest paid employees
* Employees joined after 2015
* Most experienced employee in the organization
* Salary-based filtering (salary > 25k)
* Top 5 highest and lowest paid employees
* Total and average salary of the organization
* Youngest employee in a specific department

## 📅 Week 6 – Day 1: Java 8 Programming – Smart City Transport & Service Management System

Worked on a **large-scale, real-world Java 8 case study** focusing on **modern functional programming, interface-driven design, and stream-based analytics** to model a **Smart City Transport & Service Management System**.

This system integrates **buses, metros, taxis, and EV charging stations** to manage routes, schedules, passenger data, and real-time dashboards in a clean and extensible way.

---

### 📌 Scenario Overview

The City Council plans to launch a unified platform to:

* Optimize transport routes and schedules
* Process and analyze passenger and revenue data
* Display live dashboards for city-wide transport services
* Seamlessly extend the system to future services like ferries or bike rentals

The solution leverages **Java 8 features** to ensure flexibility, readability, and scalability.

---

### 🔹 Java 8 Features & Design Concepts Applied

* **Lambda Expressions**
  Used for filtering and sorting transport schedules based on user preferences such as earliest departure time and lowest fare.

* **Method References**
  Applied for concise printing of available services, logging operations, and invoking static utility methods for fare calculations.

* **Default Methods in Interfaces**
  Defined common behavior like `printServiceDetails()` in the `TransportService` interface, shared across all transport types.

* **Static Methods in Interfaces**
  Implemented utility logic such as `calculateDistance()` inside a `GeoUtils` interface for distance computation.

* **Stream API**
  Used to group and aggregate passenger data, calculate revenue, and identify top-used routes.

* **forEach() Method**
  Displayed live schedules of all active transport services on dashboards.

* **Collectors API**

  * `groupingBy()` – Grouped passengers by route
  * `partitioningBy()` – Separated peak vs non-peak trips
  * `summarizingDouble()` – Calculated total and average fares

* **Interface-Based Design**
  Implemented `TransportService` using:

  * `BusService`
  * `MetroService`
  * `TaxiService`

* **Functional Interfaces**
  Created a `FareCalculator` functional interface, implemented using lambdas for flexible fare computation.

* **Marker Interfaces**
  Used an `EmergencyService` marker interface to prioritize services like Ambulance and Fire Service that can bypass traffic rules.

---

### 🔹 Real-Time System Flow

1. Passenger books a trip → Lambda expressions filter and sort available services
2. Dashboard updates → `forEach()` displays live transport schedules
3. Revenue reports generated → Collectors group and summarize data
4. System expansion → New services added by implementing interfaces
5. Emergency handling → Marker interface detects and prioritizes emergency services
