## 📘 Java IO Streams Practice

### 🔹 Week 1 – Day 1: CSV & JSON Data Handling (IO Streams)

**Branch:** `java-iostreams-practice`

Worked on **file-based data processing** using Java IO Streams, focusing on **CSV and JSON formats** with real-world, data-centric scenarios.

### 🧪 CSV Data Handling – Practice Problems

* Read CSV files and printed student records in structured format
* Created and wrote employee data into CSV files
* Counted total records excluding headers
* Filtered student records based on marks criteria
* Searched employee details by name
* Updated CSV records (salary increment for IT department)
* Sorted records by salary and displayed top-paid employees
* Validated CSV data using regex (email, phone number)
* Converted CSV rows into Java objects and stored them in collections
* Merged multiple CSV files based on common keys
* Processed large CSV files efficiently in chunks
* Detected duplicate records using ID comparison
* Generated CSV reports from database records
* Converted CSV ↔ JSON
* Applied encryption and decryption on sensitive CSV fields

### 🏏 IPL Censor Analyzer – Real-World File Processing

* Read IPL match data from **CSV and JSON files**
* Applied censorship rules:

  * Masked team names
  * Redacted player of the match
* Generated sanitized output files in **CSV and JSON formats**
