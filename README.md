## 📘 Java Collections

### 🔹 Week 1 – Day 1: Java Generics (Scenario-Based)

**Branch:** `java-collections`

* Solved **real-world, scenario-based Java programs** using **Generics**
* Practiced **generic classes, generic methods, bounded type parameters, and wildcards**
* Built type-safe and reusable solutions across multiple domains

**Problems Solved**

* **Smart Warehouse Management System** – Bounded generic storage with wildcard display
* **Dynamic Online Marketplace** – Generic product catalog with dynamic discount application
* **Multi-Level University Course Management System** – Generic course handler with wildcards

## 📘 Java Collections – Week 1 Day 2

### 🔹 Collections Framework: List, Set, Queue & Map Interfaces

**Branch:** `java-collections`

Worked on **core Java Collections Framework** by solving **problem-oriented and real-world scenario-based questions**, focusing on **List, Set, Queue, and Map interfaces** and their practical use cases.

---

### 📌 List Interface Problems

* Reversed elements of a list without using built-in reverse methods (ArrayList & LinkedList)
* Counted frequency of elements using Map
* Rotated list elements by a given position
* Removed duplicates while preserving insertion order
* Found the Nth element from the end of a LinkedList using two-pointer logic

---

### 📌 Set Interface Problems

* Checked equality of two sets regardless of order
* Computed union, intersection, and symmetric difference
* Converted HashSet into a sorted list
* Verified subset relationships between sets

---

### 📌 Insurance Policy Management System (Set-Based)

* Managed unique insurance policies using:

  * `HashSet` for fast lookup
  * `LinkedHashSet` for insertion order
  * `TreeSet` for sorting by expiry date
* Retrieved:

  * All unique policies
  * Policies expiring within 30 days
  * Policies by coverage type
  * Duplicate policies by policy number
* Compared performance of different Set implementations

---

### 📌 Queue Interface Problems

* Reversed a queue using only queue operations
* Generated first N binary numbers using a queue
* Simulated hospital triage using `PriorityQueue`
* Implemented a stack using two queues
* Built a circular buffer using a fixed-size queue

---

### 📌 Map Interface Problems

* Word frequency counter using `HashMap`
* Inverted a map while handling duplicate values
* Found key with maximum value
* Merged two maps by summing values
* Grouped employee objects by department

---

### 📌 Real-World Map-Based Systems

* **Insurance Policy Management System**

  * `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap` usage
  * Policy retrieval, expiry filtering, cleanup
* **Voting System**

  * HashMap for vote counting
  * TreeMap for sorted results
  * LinkedHashMap for vote order
* **Shopping Cart**

  * HashMap for prices
  * LinkedHashMap for insertion order
  * TreeMap for price-based sorting
* **Banking System**

  * HashMap for accounts
  * TreeMap for balance sorting
  * Queue for withdrawal processing
