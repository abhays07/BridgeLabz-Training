# 📘 Java DSA Practice

This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning journey in Java**, organized **week-wise and day-wise**, focusing on **problem-driven and real-world implementations**.

---

## 📅 Week 1: (Core DSA)

### 🔹 Day 1: Linked List – Initial Setup & Fundamentals

* Created a new Git branch **`java-dsa-practice`**
* Completed **initial project and folder structure setup** for DSA practice
* Worked on **Linked List data structure** and its variations
* Implemented:

  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Circular Linked List
* Practiced **node creation, pointer manipulation, and traversal**
* Handled edge cases such as:

  * Empty list
  * Insertion and deletion at head and tail
  * Circular list traversal
* Followed clean, modular, and readable **DSA coding practices**

---

### 🧪 Problems Implemented

* Student Record Management (Singly Linked List)
* Movie Management System (Doubly Linked List)
* Task Scheduler (Circular Linked List)
* Inventory Management System (Singly Linked List)
* Library Management System (Doubly Linked List)
* Round Robin CPU Scheduling (Circular Linked List)
* Social Media Friend Connections
* Undo / Redo Text Editor
* Online Ticket Reservation System

---

### 🛠 Concepts & Tools Used

* **DSA Concepts**

  * Linked List operations
  * Head & tail management
  * Circular traversal
  * Time-complexity awareness
* **Java**

  * Classes & Objects
  * Encapsulation
* **Eclipse IDE**

  * Multi-class project structure
  * Debugging pointer logic
* **Git & GitHub**

  * Created `java-dsa-practice` branch
  * Organized DSA folder structure
  * Maintained clean and meaningful commits
