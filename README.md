# 🚀 Java 8 Programming Practice

## 📅 Week 1 – Day 1: Lambda Expressions & Method References

**Branch:** `java8-programming-practice`

Worked on **Java 8 functional programming concepts**, focusing on **Lambda Expressions** and **Method References** through **real-world, scenario-based problems**. Emphasis was on reducing boilerplate code, improving readability, and implementing behavior-driven logic using functional interfaces.

### 🧪 Scenario-Based Problems Implemented

#### 🔹 Lambda Expressions

* **Smart Home Lighting Automation**

  * Implemented dynamic light activation behaviors (motion detection, time-based triggers, voice commands) using lambda expressions without creating multiple concrete classes.

* **Custom Sorting in E-Commerce**

  * Applied lambda expressions with `Comparator` to sort products dynamically based on price, rating, and discount during sales campaigns.

* **Notification Filtering**

  * Used lambda expressions with `Predicate` to filter hospital notifications based on user-defined alert preferences.

---

#### 🔹 Method References

* **Hospital Patient ID Printing**

  * Printed patient IDs using method references to simplify iteration logic.

* **Employee Name Uppercasing**

  * Converted employee names to uppercase using `String::toUpperCase` within Java Streams.

* **Invoice Object Creation**

  * Used constructor references to dynamically generate invoice objects from transaction IDs.
